# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

As a Developer, I like to write code, creating projects, and discovering new concepts. I occasionally work on Machine Learning too. I believe in learning through action, which is why Iâ€™m constantly working on new projects. Always learning, always creating.

For interesting discussions, collaborations, or idea sharing, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email. Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities and ideas.
